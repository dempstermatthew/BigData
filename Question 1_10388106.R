# Question 1.
# a.	Install the MASS package, load the library and access the Boston
# dataset contained in it. Load the help file and read about the dataset.
# How many observations are there in the dataset?

# Install package
install.packages('MASS')
library(MASS)

# Load in the data
data(Boston)

# Run the help
?Boston
help(Boston)

# How many observations are there in the dataset.
# From the description we can see 506 rows and 14 columns.


# b.	Look at the structure of the dataset and describe it briefly.
str(Boston)
# From the description we can see the following
# This data frame contains the following columns:
#   
#   crim
# per capita crime rate by town.
# 
# zn
# proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
# 
# indus
# proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
# 
# chas
# Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).
# 
# nox
# nitrogen oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).
# 
# rm
# average number of rooms per dwelling.
# 
# age
# proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.
# 
# dis
# weighted mean of distances to five Boston employment centres.
# 
# rad
# index of accessibility to radial highways.
# 
# tax
# full-value property-tax rate per \$10,000.
# 
# ptratio
# pupil-teacher ratio by town.
# 
# black
# 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town.
# 
# lstat
# lower status of the population (percent).
# 
# medv
# median value of owner-occupied homes in \$1000s.

# What unit is the nitrogen oxide variable measured in?
# parters per million

# c.	Find the mean and standard deviation for the room variable in the dataset.

mean(Boston$rm)
# 6.284634
sd(Boston$rm)
# 0.7026171

# d.	For the Charles river variable which group has the highest mean
# value medv and what is the mean value for this treatment?

tapply(Boston$medv, Boston$chas, mean)
# tapplu(variable for mean, group to split, function to get here it's mean)
?tapply()

# e.	Create a linear regression for Boston with medv as the response variable
# against the other variables. Which variables are statistically significant
# variable to predict the medv?
#The left hand is the dependent variable, the right hand is the independent varialble.
#lm( mpg ~ wt, data= mtcars )
#...to see how mileage per gallon depend on weight. Take a look at ?formula for some more explanations.
#The dot means "any columns from data that are otherwise not used"
